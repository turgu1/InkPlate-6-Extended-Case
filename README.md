# InkPlate-6-Extended-Case

This is a first step at designing a change to the current InkPlate-6 case such that it would be possible to add a small electronic board with push buttons below the mainboard. To do it, I took the original design from e-Radionica and extended a side of it, so the original portion of the case remains unchanged. The original licensing remains GPL-3.
